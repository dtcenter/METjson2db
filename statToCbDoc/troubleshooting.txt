Troubleshooting is driven by settings in the troubleshoot.json
The run will load this file from the working directory.

NOTE:
In production, please set the following to false:
    "enableTrackContextFlushToFile": false,
    "enableTrackContextFlushToDb": false,

Current implementation of troubleshooting focuses on 
narrowing down data upload errors.  Since the data is converted
to JSON documents with unique IDs, it achieves this by tracking specific
document IDs.


For example, the configuration below:

    "terminateAtFirstTrackError" : true,
    "idTrack": {
        "actions": [
            "verifyWithDbRead",
            "checkForEmptyDocsInDb"
        ],
        "idList": [
            ":V11.1.0:FV3_GSL_C384:20240801_000000:P100:VGRD:P100:CONUS:SL1L2",
            ":V11.1.0:GFS:20240203_120000:P10:SPFH:P10:PNA:SL1L2"
        ]
    },

will check each ID in the idList using the actions listed.

action: verifyWithDbRead
------------------------
Verifies the document currently just upserted with an immediate DB
read of the same and compares both.

action: checkForEmptyDocsInDb
After each upsert, checks if there are any empty documents in the DB.
Note that this queries the entire DB for empty (null) documents.
